/// The Tscene class contains the spatial representation of the "world" the
/// agents live in.
/// Theoretically, in a continuous model, there are no boundaries to the size of
/// the world.
/// Agents know their position (the x/y co-ordinates). However, to find the
/// nearest neighbors of
/// an agent, it makes sense to put them in some kind of "boxes". In this
/// implementation, the
/// infinite world is divided by a dynamic quadtree structure. There are some
/// CPU cycles
/// required to update the structure with each agent position change. But the
/// gain in looking
/// up the neighbors is worth this. The quadtree structure only needs to be
/// changed when an
/// agent leaves its box, which might only happen every 100th or 1000th
/// timestep, depending on
/// the box size.
/// The Tscene class needs an outer boundary in order to construct the initial
/// box of the
/// quadtree. Agents are not allowed to go outside that boundary. If you do not
/// know how far
/// they will walk, choose a rather big boundary box. The quadtree algorythm
/// will dynamically
/// assign smaller sub-boxes within if required.
/// If all (most) agents walk out of a box, it is no longer needed. It can be
/// colleted. If
/// there are some agents left, they will be assigned to the box above in the
/// hierarchy. You must
/// trigger this collection process periodically by calling cleanup() manually.
